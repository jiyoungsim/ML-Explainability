# NYC-Taxi-Fare-Prediction--ML-Explainability

+ Used techniques like permutation importance, partial dependence plots, and SHAP values to extract human-understandable insights from models, such as feature importance and how each feature affects predictions, both in big-picture sense and for particular prediction points.
+ Generated new features based on the insights in order to make improvements to the baseline model.
+ The focus of this project is on Machine Learning explainability. Thus the model itself has not been optimized/tuned for the purpose of this project. See other projects for more on model building and tuning.
